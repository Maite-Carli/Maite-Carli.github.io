Since October 2024, I am a PhD student at Utrecht University under the supervision of [Gijs Heuts](https://sites.google.com/site/gijsheuts/home). Previously, I studied at EPFL (Beachelor) and the University of Bonn (Master). My research interests are broadly in homotopy theory, especially in unstable and chromatic homotopy theory or ideally at the intersection of both. Recently, I have been particularly interested in the interactions between different heights.
