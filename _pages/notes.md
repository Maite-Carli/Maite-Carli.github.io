Here are some notes I wrote. Warning: There may be typos, so read at your own risk!  

-[Descendability, the Smash Product Theorem and Chromatic Convergence](/files/The_Smash_Product_Theorem-2.pdf)  
Notes to an expository talk about the Smash Product Theorem through the lense of nilpotence and descent that I gave at the [European Talbot 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/european-talbot/).  
-[Examples of Chromatic Redshift](/files/Examples_of_chromatic_redshift-3.pdf)  
Notes to an expository talk on Allen Yuan's paper, Examples of Chromatic Redshift in Algebraic K-theory.  
-[Stacks, Spectra and Elliptic Cohomology](/files/Master_thesis_Carli.pdf)  
My Master thesis, containing exposition on the role of stacks in homotopy theory and their connection to spectra and Hopf algebroids as well as an account of the Landweber Exact Functor Theorem and elliptic cohomology. 
-[The Hopf Invariant One Problem](/files/The_Hopf_invariant_one_problem-2.pdf)  
Notes to an expository talk on the proof of the Hopf invariant one problem using complex K-theory.  
-[Overview on Triangulated Categories](/files/projet_bachelor_maite_carli.pdf)
