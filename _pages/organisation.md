Since September 2025, I am part of the organising team of the [European Talbot Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/european-talbot/).  
In the winter semester of 2024-2025, [Vignesh Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/vigneshsubramanian/home) and I 
organised a seminar on [Trace Methods and Computations](https://sites.google.com/view/vigneshsubramanian/seminars/trace-methods-and-computations/).  
In the winter semester of 2021-2022, I was part of the ["atelier Alkindi"](https://www.epfl.ch/education/education-and-science-outreach/fr/classes-primaires-secondaires-1/cryptographie-en-classe/) team.
Together with other Bachelor and Master students from EPFL and under the guidance of EPFL's , I conducted workshops on cryptography in Swiss secondary schools all over Switzerland, which were designed and organised by EPFL's [science outreach department](https://www.epfl.ch/education/education-and-science-outreach/science-outreach/).
Bringing the wonders of maths to middle schoolers was a lot of fun and it is an experience I would love to renew!
