-Master Thesis: [Stacks, Spectra and Elliptic Cohomology](/files/Master_thesis_Carli.pdf).  
This is my Master thesis that I wrote under the supervision of [Jack Davies](https://sites.google.com/view/jackmdavies/home).
In particular, I give a proof of a version of Landweber exactness for the spectrum P(n) using the "stacky" perspective.
